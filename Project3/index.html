<h2>SECTION ONE </h2>
<P> Nature is the ultimate source of our living.Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent,which helps
    maintain the ecosystem.Plants,animals,and humans all depend on nature for their survival.it supplies oxygen,sunlight,sunlight,soil,water,
    and other necessary components,But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature. In addition to exploiting 
    excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. It is now more essential to reduce
    biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones. People from all over the world should join forces to
    relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. It is now the most essential aim to serve our nature with utmost care to 
    save our nature from hazards and threats.

    <h2>SECTION TWO </h2>
    <p>
        Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions.
        The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural 
        ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy
        its rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment
        is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a
        single fully grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably 
        adequate for a metropolis or town.

    <h2>SECTION THREE </h2>
    <p>
        For all of us, nature is crucial. It’s the reason for the existence of life on this planet. Nature is home to many different
        creatures. All living organisms benefit from the natural balance maintained by Mother Nature. The study of the natural environment
        is a separate discipline of science. Every element has its own story to tell. Nature’s beauty is portrayed through the sun and moon,
        the plants, the flowers, etc. It is a common belief that reacting to something is a natural human characteristic.
        Naturally drawn characteristics are defined as a genetic trait of an organism in sociology. The resources of nature are plentiful.
